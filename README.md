# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project** â€” the *Foundations Course*.  
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using **HTML**.  

The website will contain a main index page that links to a few recipes.  
Itâ€™s a simple project, but it helps to practice core web development concepts such as:

- Structuring a webpage using HTML elements  
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images correctly  
- Creating links between pages (relative paths)  
- Organizing project files in a clear folder structure  
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

### ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
Once completed, this project will demonstrate my ability to:
- Write clean and semantic HTML  
- Manage a simple project with Git and GitHub  
- Understand how to plan and organize files for a website  
- Follow version control best practices (commits, push, pull, branching)

### ðŸ’­ Reflection
This project is an introduction to web development fundamentals.  
Itâ€™s helping me get comfortable with Git, GitHub, and the basic workflow of building and uploading a project.
